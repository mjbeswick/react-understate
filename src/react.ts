/**
 * React hook to subscribe to a state in functional components.
 *
 * This hook automatically subscribes to state changes and triggers
 * component re-renders when the state value changes. It properly
 * cleans up subscriptions when the component unmounts.
 *
 * **Important:** This hook does NOT return a value. Instead, access
 * the state's `.value` property directly in your component. This
 * ensures proper reactivity and avoids confusion about how to use states.
 *
 * **Requires React 18+** - This hook uses `useSyncExternalStore` for optimal
 * performance and concurrent rendering support.
 *
 * **No setup required** - React is automatically detected in most environments.
 *
 * @param signal - The state to subscribe to
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import { state, useSubscribe } from 'react-understate';
 *
 * const userCount = state(0);
 *
 * function UserCounter() {
 *   // âœ… CORRECT: Use the hook to establish subscription
 *   useSubscribe(userCount);
 *
 *   // Access the state value directly
 *   const count = userCount.value;
 *
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       <p>Active users: {count}</p>
 *       <button onClick={() => userCount.value++}>
 *         Add User
 *       </button>
 *     </div>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
